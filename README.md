### 3. Loan Prediction (Difficulty Level: medium, max. 3 Persons) 
A Finance company deals in home loans. Customers cannot apply for a home loan until the customer's creditworthiness has been confirmed. 
Scenario 
The company wants to automate the lending process so that creditworthiness is assessed when the customer fills out the online application form. The data that are asked in the form are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate the process, a model has to be created to predict creditworthiness. 
Data 
The data to create the model is stored in the file "LoanPrediction.csv". It contains the following features: 


- Variable: Description 
- Loan_ID: Unique Loan ID 
- Gender: Male/ Female 
- Married: Applicant married (Y/N) 
- Dependents: Number of dependents 
- Education: Applicant Education (Graduate/ Under Graduate) 
- Self_Employed: Self employed (Y/N) 
- ApplicantIncome: Applicant income 
- CoapplicantIncome: Coapplicant income 
- LoanAmount: Loan amount in thousands 
- Loan_Amount_Term: Term of loan in months 
- Credit_History: credit history meets guidelines 
- Property_Area: Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural 
- Loan_Status: Loan approved (Y/N) 


Group Work and Delivery:
- Each group applies the methods and procedures which were subject of the teaching sessions.
Depending on the project, different focuses have to be set, e.g. for some projects more data
preparation for others more model optimization.
- All necessary steps for the analysis should be performed in Python.
- The group work should be documented, explained, and reasoned in a text document including
code fragments that are relevant for understanding (see my Python manual for example).
- Each group delivers the text document and the corresponding Python files due to the
announced date.
- The text document has a maximum of 40 pages including the figures and code fragments.
- The applied methodology is more important for the evaluation than the model results.
